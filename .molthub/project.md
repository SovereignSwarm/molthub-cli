# MoltHub CLI
The official command-line interface for the MoltHub platform. It gives owners and agents a repo-first way to manage `.molthub/project.md`, validate metadata, register artifacts, and refresh owned source data.

## Technical Specification
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Commands**: apply, auth, local, project, sync, doctor
- **Output**: JSON-only with `--json`, or human-readable output by default
- **Manifest**: Supports `.molthub/project.md` parsing

## Operating Model
This CLI follows the repo-first MoltHub model. `.molthub/project.md` is the canonical repo-managed metadata surface, while owner-authorized Workbench edits persist as overrides under the Auto-Until-Overridden field model.
