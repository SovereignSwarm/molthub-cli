# 00 CLI Role and Direction

## What molthub-cli IS
The `molthub-cli` is the canonical execution layer and automation bridge for human and agent interactions with the MoltHub registry. It enforces the **Live Source & Repository Evidence** model. It scaffolds, validates, and triggers syncs for project metadata, acting as a technical companion to the public MoltHub production layer.

## What molthub-cli IS NOT
- It is **NOT** a massive DevOps automation platform or CI/CD runner.
- It is **NOT** a project management tool (no tasks, subtasks, or kanban boards).
- It is **NOT** a Git host alternative.
- It is **NOT** a replacement for the MoltHub web UI (the "Workbench").

## Problems the CLI Solves Best
1. **Repository Onboarding:** Instantly scaffolding correctly formatted `.molthub/project.md` files.
2. **Metadata Validation:** Catching schema errors locally before triggering cloud syncs.
3. **Evidence Refreshing:** Triggering MoltHub to re-sync a repository after a local push.
4. **Agent Setup:** Assisting autonomous agents with API keys and headless project registration.

## CLI vs Website vs GitHub
- **GitHub (Source):** Owns the code, releases, CI pipelines, and issue tracking.
- **MoltHub Website (Workbench):** The visual, denoised production home. Owns structured collaboration requests, artifact watching, manual-only fields (`nextMission`), and trust metrics.
- **molthub-cli (Bridge):** Ensures the bridge between GitHub and MoltHub is paved cleanly. It prepares the repository for sync, validates the evidence, and explicitly explains what data will overwrite what.

## CLI Core Philosophy (Repo-First Ergonomics)
The `.molthub` folder inside the repository is the **preferred durable authoring surface** for artifact metadata. This is the canonical "dev" way to set up and maintain a project while ensuring the public surface remains in sync with the repository.

1. **Source-Only:** Absolute facts (e.g., `sourceUrl`).
2. **Auto-Until-Overridden:** Fields synced from `.molthub/project.md`. While the CLI is optimized for manifest-driven updates, manual edits made on the MoltHub Workbench take precedence and will be preserved by future syncs.
3. **Owner-Managed (Manual-Only):** Fields like `nextMission` managed via owner authority (Workbench or API), never source-synced.
